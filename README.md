# UberClone

## Project Overview
UberClone is a web application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a ride-sharing platform like Uber. It provides a user-friendly interface for riders to request rides, and for drivers to manage their ride requests and status. The application aims to offer a seamless experience with vibrant UI, responsive design, and essential features.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uberclone.git
   cd uberclone
   ```

2. **Open the project in your preferred web browser**:
   Open `index.html`, `login.html`, `rider-dashboard.html`, or `driver-dashboard.html` directly in your browser.

> Note: The project does not require a web server for basic functionality; however, features involving maps or dynamic interactions might require additional server configurations in a full-fledged application.

## Usage
1. **Home Page**: Upon visiting the home page (`index.html`), users can navigate to the login page or dashboards for riders and drivers.
   
2. **Login Page**: Users can log into their accounts via the `login.html` page.

3. **Rider Dashboard**: After logging in, riders can access `rider-dashboard.html` to request rides, view ride history, and select vehicles.

4. **Driver Dashboard**: Drivers can manage ride requests and their status in `driver-dashboard.html`.

5. **History Page**: Access ride history through `history.html`.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a responsive layout.
- **Rider and Driver Dashboards**: Dedicated dashboards to manage rides for riders and drivers respectively.
- **Ride Request UI**: Users can easily request rides using a visually appealing interface.
- **Login Functionality**: A simple login page for users to access their accounts.
- **Interactive Elements**: Basic interactivity using JavaScript for toggling driver status and managing ride acceptance.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons in the interface.

You can include the following lines in your HTML files to use these libraries:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css">
```

## Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:
```
/uberclone
├── index.html            # Main landing page
├── login.html            # User login page
├── rider-dashboard.html  # Dashboard for riders to request rides
├── driver-dashboard.html # Dashboard for drivers to accept rides
├── history.html          # Page to view ride history
```

Each HTML file represents a different part of the application, ensuring a modular approach to the project.

## Conclusion
UberClone replicates the essential features of a ride-sharing application, providing a clean and responsive user interface. This is a great starting point for new developers interested in web development, frontend design, or building their own ride-sharing application.
